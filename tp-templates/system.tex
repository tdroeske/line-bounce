the top center of the user\textquoteright{}s screen and accelerate
in the -y direction only

\end{itemize}
\item Testcases: 

\begin{itemize}

place, but exiting the pause state will restore original movement

immersion in the game 
\item objects originally moving in a certain trajectory will not suddenly
change trajectory for no reason (see TES-1.3)

its trajectory changes in a fun and intuitive fashion 

\begin{itemize}
\item avatar will only change from -y to +y velocity when colliding with
the top of drawn lines (see FUN-02, FUN-45) 
\item no component of avatar\textquoteright{}s velocity will be affected
upon colliding with the bottoms of lines (see FUN-05, FUN-45) 
\item side walls (left and right) are \textquotedblleft{}solid\textquotedblright{}:
avatar will reverse x velocity upon collision (see FUN-06, FUN-19) 
\item shorter drawn platforms will give more of a boost than longer drawn
ones (see FUN-23) 
\end{itemize}
\item Testcases: 

\begin{itemize}
\item test various different environments in isolated conditions from the
bullets described in goals (ex. avatar with a velocity such that it
will collide with the top of a line only) 
\item test various different environments in various conditions from the
bullets described in goals (ex. avatar with a velocity such that it
will collide with the bottom of a line after colliding with the top
of a line) 
\item test the above two with different combinations of avatars, power-ups
that are in active/inactive statuses, arbitrarily placed lines (ranging
from extremely condensed to sparsely place ones) 
\end{itemize}
\item Capture the output
